## System Overview

Since image processing algorithms are expensive to be executed in software, hardware accelerators can be developed to increase performance for those algorithms. Hardware accelerators can consume less energy and execute fast while achieving good results.   

Developed systems: VLPD (Vehicular License Plate Detection) step for the ALPR (Automatic License Plate Recognition): FPGA implementation of VLPD using an algorithm based on morphologic operations. 

Gaussian Filter: FPGA implementation for the Gaussian filter using approximation techniques.

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/Sborzguilherme/Architecture-of-FPGA-based-Systems-for-Digital-Image-Processing/edit/master/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

# Header 1

- Bulleted
- List

1. Numbered
2. List

**Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text

[Link](url) and ![Image](src)
```

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/Sborzguilherme/Architecture-of-FPGA-based-Systems-for-Digital-Image-Processing/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
